              <ol>
                <li>First, make the tomato-based sauce by blending together the red bell peppers (pimento), tomatoes,
                  onion,
                  and
                  scotch bonnet.</li>
                <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat, then add the diced onions and let them cook
                  for
                  about
                  3 minutes or until they are soft.</li>
                <li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then stir in garlic, ginger, and bay
                  leaves—leave
                  to
                  cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the blended sauce and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced and the sauce become
                  thick
                  —about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season with thyme, curry powder, bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for another 2 to 5
                  minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the rinsed rice to the sauce and stir until it is well coated with the sauce. Then add the
                  chicken
                  stock, stir briefly, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and bring to a quick boil over high heat.</li>
                <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to low and steam
                  until
                  the
                  rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and turn off the heat. Cover it
                  immediately
                  so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little.</li>
                <li>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad.</li>

        <div class="section-text">
          <p>The African Stewed Spinach also popularly known as Efo riro is a one-pot stew with layers of flavor. Efo
            means ”Green leafy vegetable” or ”spinach”, and riro, means ”to stir”. So basically, Efo riro simply means
            ”stirred leafy vegetable”. However, we just don’t stir this by itself, we stir it in a rich pepper sauce
            which
            is loaded with Meat, Crayfish, Dry Fish, and other Meat or Fish of Choice.</p>
          <p>Stewed Spinach is often eaten with Fufu – a general term used to describe swallow foods like Eba (made with
            garri), Amala, Plantain Fufu, Pounded Yam, and more. On the lighter side, you can serve this over Rice or
            boiled Puna Yam.</p>

                <li>Blend the bell peppers, scotch bonnet, and onion.</li>
                <li>Preheat the palm oil - I like it hot but not bleached. Add the diced onion and stir-fry till golden
                  brown.
                  Add the blended peppers and fry until the sauce thickens up. It takes about 15 minutes, and you need
                  to
                  stir
                  constantly to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crayfish, locust bean, bouillon cube, and salt to taste. Stir until everything is well
                  blended.</li>
                <li>Add the meat, stockfish, and dried prawns and add some water or stock to thin out the sauce, then

                  up again and allow it to come to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Finally, add the spinach and mix well. Then leave it to cook uncovered for about 2 to 5 minutes.

        <div class="section-text">
          <p>Asaro which is also known as Yam pottage or Yam porridge is a very delicious yam recipe. Though it’s eaten
            by
            most tribes in Nigeria, it is more common in the Yoruba-speaking parts of Nigeria. It’s also easy to make.
            If
            you love yam, it’s a must-try recipe!</p>

                <p>There are a few things to note when making the Nigerian Yam Pottage (Yam porridge):</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>It’s best to use the freshest Palm Oil you can possibly get because stale palm oil will ruin the
                    taste
                    of the Pottage.</li>
                  <li>It’s best to use as little seasoning as possible because the yam itself is sweet so the excessive
                    seasoning will overshadow the sweet taste of the Pottage. </li>
                  <li>Add a little more water if necessary but don’t overdo it.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4 class="aside-title-color aside-faq-title">Frequently asked questions</h4>
                <p>DO THEY PUT SUGAR IN ASARO? </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>There are no rules. If you prefer sugar, you can add it, especially when making this recipe with
                    the
                    new
                    yam. The new yam has not yet developed the natural sweetness that comes with the older yam. However,
                    I
                    recommend that you shouldn’t add sugar to older yams because they are sweet enough. Sugar will alter
                    the
                    natural taste of the porridge. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>HOW MUCH SHOULD I MASH YAM PORRIDGE?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mash your yam porridge with a wooden spoon or potato masher. How much you mash depends on your
                    preference. I like to leave some yam chunks in my yam porridge, so I mash about 50%.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>PALM OIL/VEGETABLE OIL</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Although vegetable oil can be an alternative to palm oil, it doesn’t fit the recipe perfectly. The
                    best
                    option is to use palm oil because it brings out the flavor of the recipe and it adds color to the
                    porridge.</li>
